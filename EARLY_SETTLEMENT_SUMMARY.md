## ⚡ Key Features Delivered

1. **✅ Early Settlement Requests**: Users can request early settlement with bank deposit details
2. **✅ File Attachments**: Upload deposit screenshots and bank statements  
3. **✅ Admin Approval**: Secure approval workflow with status tracking
4. **✅ Balance Management**: Automatic safe balance updates upon approval
5. **✅ Audit Trail**: Complete logging via existing audit system
6. **✅ Permission Control**: Role-based access with safe assignments
7. **✅ Validation**: Eligibility checks and business rule enforcement

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Eligibility Requirements
- Cheque must be assigned to a safe
- Cheque must not be already settled
- Cheque must not be cancelled
- No existing pending early settlement

### When Approved
- Cheque status → "settled"
- Cheque `is_settled` → True
- Settlement date recorded
- Safe balance increased by deposit amount
- Audit log created

### File Management
- 10MB file size limit
- Secure file storage
- Access control for downloads
- File type validation

## 📋 Database Tables Created

The implementation automatically creates these tables when the server starts:

```sql
-- Early settlements
early_settlements (
  id, cheque_id, deposit_number, deposit_amount, 
  deposit_date, bank_deposit_reference, notes, 
  status, settlement_date, created_by, approved_by, 
  created_at, updated_at
)

-- File attachments  
early_settlement_files (
  id, early_settlement_id, filename, original_filename,
  file_path, file_size, mime_type, file_type,
  uploaded_by, uploaded_at
)
```

## ✨ Ready to Use

The early settlement feature is now fully implemented and ready for use! Users can:

1. **Submit early settlement requests** with bank deposit information
2. **Upload supporting documents** like deposit screenshots
3. **Track settlement status** through the approval process
4. **Have balances automatically updated** when approved

The system maintains full security, audit trails, and integrates seamlessly with the existing cheque and safe management functionality.
