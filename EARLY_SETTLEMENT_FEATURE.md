## Usage Workflow

### 1. User Creates Early Settlement Request
```python
# Check eligibility first
response = requests.get(f"/cheques/{cheque_id}/eligible-for-early-settlement")

# Create settlement request
settlement_data = {
    "cheque_id": 1,
    "deposit_number": "DEP123456",
    "deposit_amount": 5000.00,
    "deposit_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "notes": "Early settlement due to bank deposit"
}
response = requests.post("/early-settlements", json=settlement_data)
```

### 2. Upload Deposit Screenshot
```python
# Upload file
files = {'file': open('deposit_screenshot.jpg', 'rb')}
data = {'file_type': 'deposit_screenshot'}
response = requests.post(f"/early-settlements/{settlement_id}/upload", 
                        files=files, data=data)
```

### 3. Admin Reviews and Approves
```python
# Review settlements
response = requests.get("/early-settlements?status=pending")

# Approve settlement
approval_data = {
    "status": "approved",
    "notes": "Verified bank deposit - approved"
}
response = requests.put(f"/early-settlements/{settlement_id}/approve", 
                       json=approval_data)
```

## Security & Permissions

### User Permissions
- **View**: Users need `can_view` permission for the safe
- **Create**: Users need `can_create_expense` permission for the safe
- **Upload**: File uploaders or users with safe access can upload
- **Delete**: Only file uploaders and authorized users can delete files

### Admin Only Actions
- Approve/reject early settlements
- Access all settlements regardless of safe assignments

### File Security
- Files stored in dedicated directory: `uploads/early_settlement_files/`
- Unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- File type validation for security
- Size limits to prevent abuse
- Access control for downloads

## Integration with Existing System

### Cheque Model Updates
- Added `early_settlements` relationship
- Existing settlement logic preserved
- No breaking changes to current functionality

### Safe Balance Management
- Automatic balance updates upon approval
- Consistent with existing expense system
- Audit trail maintained

### Status Management
When early settlement is approved:
1. Cheque status ‚Üí "settled"
2. Cheque `is_settled` ‚Üí True
3. Settlement date recorded
4. Safe balance increased by deposit amount

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios and responses:

### Cheque Not Eligible
```json
{
  "status_code": 400,
  "detail": "Cheque must be assigned to a safe for early settlement"
}
```

### Permission Denied
```json
{
  "status_code": 403,
  "detail": "Access to create early settlements for this safe not permitted"
}
```

}
```

### File Size Exceeded
```json
{
  "status_code": 400,
  "detail": "File size exceeds 10MB limit"
}
```

## Testing Examples

### Complete Early Settlement Flow
```python
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"

# 1. Create early settlement
settlement_data = {
    "cheque_id": 1,
    "deposit_number": "DEP123456",
    "deposit_amount": 5000.00,
    "deposit_date": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "notes": "Bank deposit completed early"
}

response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/early-settlements-simple", 
                        json=settlement_data)
settlement = response.json()
settlement_id = settlement["settlement"]["id"]

# 2. List settlements
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/early-settlements-simple")
settlements = response.json()

# 3. Approve settlement
approval_data = {
    "status": "approved",
    "notes": "Verified and approved"
}
response = requests.put(f"{BASE_URL}/early-settlements-simple/{settlement_id}/approve",
                       json=approval_data)
```
