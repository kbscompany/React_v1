  -d '{
    "cheque_id": 1,
    "deposit_number": "DEP123456",
    "deposit_amount": 5000.00,
    "deposit_date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
    "notes": "Early bank deposit"
  }'
```

```

### 3. Approve Settlement (Admin)
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/early-settlements-simple/1/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "approved",
    "notes": "Verified bank deposit"
  }'
```

## 🔧 Frontend Integration

The early settlement functionality can be integrated into your frontend by calling these API endpoints. The frontend is already running and can be accessed at http://localhost:3000.

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ **Role-based access control** 
- ✅ **Safe assignment validation**
- ✅ **Admin-only approval process**
- ✅ **File upload security** (10MB limit, type validation)
- ✅ **Audit trail logging**

## 📂 File Upload Support

Users can attach:
- 📸 **Deposit screenshots** (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- 📄 **Bank statements** (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- 📋 **Supporting documents**

## 🎯 Business Logic

### When Early Settlement is Approved:
1. Cheque status → "settled"
2. Cheque `is_settled` → True  
3. Settlement date recorded
4. Safe balance **increased** by deposit amount
5. Audit log created

### Eligibility Requirements:
- Cheque must be assigned to a safe
- Cheque must not be already settled
- Cheque must not be cancelled
- No existing pending early settlement

## 🎊 Ready to Use!

Your early settlement feature is **production-ready** and fully functional. Users can now:

- ✅ Submit early settlement requests with bank deposit details
- ✅ Upload supporting documents like deposit screenshots  
- ✅ Track settlement status through approval process
- ✅ Have safe balances automatically updated when approved

The system maintains full security, audit trails, and integrates seamlessly with existing cheque and safe management functionality.
